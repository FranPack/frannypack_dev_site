# FrannyPack.dev


## How it works?

My portfolio uses ReactJS. To make it easier for me to update the website, the projects are added dynamically. Each project page is written in Markdown with metadata associated with it.\

```jsx {1-7} showlinenumbers title="projects/portfolio.mdx - Frontmatter"

# Content
    --> Content
```
```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown'
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'

ReactDom.render(
  <ReactMarkdown remarkPlugins={[[remarkGfm, {singleTilde: false}]]}>
    This ~is not~ strikethrough, but ~~this is~~!
  </ReactMarkdown>,
  document.body
)
```
